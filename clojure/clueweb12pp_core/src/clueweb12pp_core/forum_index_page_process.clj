;;;; Code to process a generic index page.
;;;; The idea is:
;;;;  - We get a regex for what the topic pages are supposed to look
;;;; like
;;;;  - We get a list of dates on the page and these dates are
;;;; considered to be the dates of the post pages. We get all post
;;;; page links and harvest the links out.
